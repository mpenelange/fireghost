<p align="center">
  Self-hosted, Rust-native web crawler &amp; scraper for AI agents
</p>

The open-source alternative to Firecrawl: one static Rust binary, ~50 MB RAM
idle, a Firecrawl-compatible REST API on **both `/v1/*` and `/v2/*`** (scrape,
crawl, map, search, extract, plus v2 batch & parse) — a drop-in for the official
Firecrawl SDKs — plus first-class MCP. Self-host free under AGPL-3.0.

**This fork** swaps the browser layer to [Camofox](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-browser)
(Firefox anti-detect) and re-backs search on it — details [below](#-this-is-the-camofox-fork).
Upstream offers a managed API at `api.fastcrw.com`; this fork is self-host only.

## 🦊 This is the Camofox fork

This is a fork of [`crw`](https://github.com/us/crw) that swaps the browser layer
to [**Camofox**](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-browser) (the Camoufox/Firefox
anti-detect browser, driven over its REST API) and re-backs search on it. Changes
vs. upstream — all **additive and config-toggled**:

| Area | Upstream `crw` | This fork |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Default JS render ladder | `HTTP → LightPanda → Chrome` (CDP) | `HTTP → LightPanda → Camofox` (Firefox) |
| Stealth tier | browserless Chromium (SSPL); opt-in in-process Camoufox tier | **Camofox** ([camofox-browser](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-browser), REST-driven) — engine-level fingerprint evasion, the default tier, shared by render *and* search |
| `/v1/search` backend | SearXNG sidecar | **8 engines built in** — Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, YouTube, Reddit, Amazon, GitHub (no sidecar) |
| Interactive MCP | `crw-browse` (CDP, 2 tools) | Upstream **[`camofox-mcp`](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-mcp)** wired into the Docker stack — 47 tools over Camofox REST |

**What sets this fork apart:**

- **One less moving part.** Upstream's `/v1/search` needs a SearXNG sidecar; this fork
  searches Google through the **same Camofox browser it already runs to render pages**.
  `docker compose up` gives you working search with no extra container to deploy,
  version, or keep healthy.
- **Search that actually returns results.** In the production setup below, the SearXNG
  backend came back **empty for every query**; the Camofox-driven backend (Google by
  default) reliably returns real results.
- **Anti-detection at the engine level.** Camofox is Camoufox (Firefox) with fingerprint
  evasion **built into the browser**. Upstream now ships its own opt-in Camoufox tier too,
  but it's an in-process *renderer* only — search still needs the SearXNG sidecar. Here one
  browser covers both rendering *and* search by default, so there's no Chromium heap plus a
  search sidecar to run side by side.
- **Many engines, one ranked list.** Search defaults to Google but can query up to four of
  Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, YouTube, Reddit, Amazon, and GitHub in a single call
  (run sequentially, so latency scales with engine count), deduping by URL and agreement-ranking
  the merged results — where upstream is tied to one SearXNG instance.

**Field notes — used in production by Hermes.** This fork backs the **Hermes**
agent over MCP, with Hermes' built-in `web` and `browser` tools **disabled** so
every fetch/search routes through this fork instead of its flaky native tools.
In that setup the upstream **SearXNG backend was returning nothing at all** —
empty results for every query. The **Camofox-driven Google backend reliably
finds results**, and the Camofox render tier even **loads pages sitting behind
bot checks** that the previous stack couldn't get past.

---

## Why crw-camofox?

- **Rust-native engine** — the core is one static Rust binary (no Redis, Node.js, or Python). The Camofox (Firefox) browser runs as a separate container, pulled in only for JS rendering, stealth, and search — plain HTTP fetches never touch it.
- **Light idle footprint** — the engine idles around ~50 MB; the Camofox browser only spins up for heavy renders. Browser-render-first stacks (Firecrawl, Crawl4AI) carry a Chromium heap baseline measured in hundreds of MB before a single request lands.
- **Anti-detect by default** — the stealth tier is Camofox (Camoufox/Firefox with engine-level fingerprint evasion), and search runs through the same browser, so bot-walled pages and web search both work without bolting on a separate Chromium or SearXNG sidecar.
- **Firecrawl-compatible drop-in** — both the `/v1/*` and `/v2/*` surfaces (scrape, crawl, map, search, extract; plus v2-only batch & parse) with compatible request/response shapes. The v2 API is a drop-in for the official `firecrawl-py` v4 SDK (`FirecrawlApp(api_url="http://localhost:3000")`) — swap the base URL and keep your code.
- **Change tracking** — diff a page against a prior snapshot (markdown git-diff, per-field JSON, or both) with an optional LLM "meaningful-change" judge. A stateless `changeTracking` primitive in the engine — wire it into your own scheduler. See the [Monitoring docs](https://us.github.io/crw/monitoring).
- **AGPL-3.0, self-host only** — run the whole stack yourself under AGPL-3.0. This fork operates no managed tier: no account, no usage metering, no API keys.

## Quickstart

Self-host the full stack with one command — no auth:

```bash
docker compose up -d        # crw + lightpanda + camofox + camofox-mcp
```

This brings up the REST API on `localhost:3000` plus the real render ladder
(HTTP → LightPanda → Camofox) and Camofox-driven search, so JS-heavy pages and
web search work out of the box.

The full REST surface (`/v1/*` + `/v2/*`) is listed under
[API endpoints](#api-endpoints) below.

### MCP

The Compose stack exposes two MCP servers over Streamable HTTP — point any
MCP agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue.dev, Codex, Gemini CLI)
at whichever fits the job:

**Scraping** — `crw`'s own `/mcp`, 6 tools to *fetch* pages (`crw_scrape`,
`crw_crawl`, `crw_check_crawl_status`, `crw_map`, `crw_search`, `crw_parse_file`):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http crw http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

**Interactive browser** — for agents that must *operate* a site (log in, fill
forms, click through flows), the upstream
[`camofox-mcp`](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-mcp) server drives a live
[Camofox](https://github.com/redf0x1/camofox-browser) (Firefox) browser: 47 tools
(navigate, click, type, scroll, evaluate, screenshot, cookies, …). It's a separate
server on `localhost:9378` and needs a bearer token; the stack ships a
loopback-only dev key:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http camofox http://localhost:9378/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer crw-local-dev-insecure-default-key"
```

> [!WARNING]
> These tools drive a real browser. Before exposing port 9378 beyond localhost,
> set your own `CAMOFOX_HTTP_API_KEY` in `.env` (≥32 chars, e.g.
> `openssl rand -hex 24`) and use that token instead of the dev key.

### Agent skills

Drop-in [Agent Skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that teach an
agent when to use each tool suite live in [`skills/`](skills/):

- [**`crw-web`**](skills/crw-web/SKILL.md) — the crw tools (scrape / search / crawl / map / parse): when to use each, `crw_search` engine selection, and output limits.
- [**`camofox-browser`**](skills/camofox-browser/SKILL.md) — the camofox-mcp interactive browser: the full tool reference and the "escalate only for real interactivity" rule. Requires the `camofox-mcp` server.

## Build from source

This fork is distributed as the multi-arch Docker image
**`ghcr.io/adambenhassen/crw-camofox`** (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) used by the
Compose stack above; upstream's `npm`/`pip`/`brew`/`cargo`/`apt` packages are
**not** this fork (they default to Chrome + SearXNG). To build the binaries yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adambenhassen/crw-camofox
cd crw-camofox
cargo build --release -p crw-server --features cdp,camofox -p crw-mcp -p crw-cli
```

|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/scrape` | Scrape a single URL, optionally with LLM extraction or summary |
| `POST` | `/v1/crawl` | Start async BFS crawl (returns job ID) |
| `GET` | `/v1/crawl/:id` | Check crawl status and retrieve results |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/crawl/:id` | Cancel a running crawl job |

## Security

- **SSRF protection** — blocks loopback, private IPs, cloud metadata (`169.254.x.x`), IPv6 mapped addresses, and non-HTTP schemes (`file://`, `data:`)
- **Auth** — optional Bearer token with constant-time comparison
- **robots.txt** — RFC 9309 compliant with wildcard patterns
- **Rate limiting** — token-bucket algorithm, returns 429 with `error_code`
- **Resource limits** — max request body 1 MB; per-crawl depth and page count bounded (configurable; defaults: depth 2, 100 pages)
