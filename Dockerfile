# The builder runs on the NATIVE build platform (`--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM`)
# and cross-compiles to the requested target arch. Previously the builder ran
# under QEMU for linux/arm64, which emulated the *entire* Rust compile and took
# ~2h per release. Cross-compiling on the native runner brings arm64 back to
# minutes; only the tiny runtime layer (ca-certificates) still touches QEMU.
